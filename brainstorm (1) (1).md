## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Errands
    **Mobile**: This app is more than just a glorified website, it contains an interactive map and many different views to organize the content. The app will also use location to show pins that are closest to the user.
    **Story**: The value is inherit in an app like this. I think everyone would like to believe that a simple notes app is enough, but adding this extra layer of visualization will urge users to actually start taking notes on their daily activities. I believe my friends and family would respond very well to it, as long as I stick to simplicity. Complexity is a killer to the marketability of this app since its purpose its designed to be quick and easy.
    **Market**: People who move around a lot, and do a ton of chores/things in their lives.
    **Habit**: An average user of this app would open it multiple times a day to jot down something quick. The user doesn't just consume, but create which means that the only reason they would open my app is if they have something they need to remember. This happens often.
    **Scope**: The scope is just right since I am sticking to simplicity. A few screens, with a smooth map feature. The most challenging part of this app may be the MapKit usage.
    
1. HitchHike
    **Mobile**: HitchHike is more than a simple carpooling website. It features real-time tracking, secure payments, and a rating system within the mobile app, providing a seamless and reliable experience for college students.
    **Story**: The value of HitchHike lies in its ability to connect college students for cost-effective and secure rides home or on breaks. By offering features like real-time tracking and secure payments, it ensures a reliable and community-driven transportation network, fostering trust and convenience among users.
    **Market**: College students seeking cost-effective and secure transportation options for breaks or other occasions.
    **Habit**: Users of HitchHike are likely to open the app when they need to arrange transportation, whether it's for a break, holiday, or any other occasion. As such, the app caters to a need-driven usage pattern, with users actively creating and participating in carpooling arrangements.
    **Scope**: The scope of HitchHike is BIG. There are a lot of features to implement with just one engineer. I also think that a stripped down version of the app just won't be worth it.
